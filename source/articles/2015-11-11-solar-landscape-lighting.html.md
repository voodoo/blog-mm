Landscape lighting is a neat use for solar. If you have ever seen the solar section at the big box stores you will see many different types of solar lighting.

I wanted to create my own - and take advantage of a simple design benefit of centralizing your battery and panel 


### so you can ...

- Place the (bigger) panel in the sun
- Share a centralized (bigger) battery
- Mmore control of what lighting fixures you use
- More control of the timer/timing of when the lights come on
- Use different power lights - standard 3.2v and 12.v

### Parts

- Battery - LifePO4
- Controller - PWM
- Panel - 100w - MC4 connection to controller
- 3.2v buss
- 3.2 DC-DC down converter
- 12v buss
- Voltmeter with on/off switch
- Master on/off switch
