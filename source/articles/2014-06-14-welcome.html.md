## I am Voodoo

No, really, on github that is my handle. [Find me there!](http://github.com/voodoo)

What will you find here? Just stuff enjoy - programming, guitars, technology, solar. Mostly this is just for my own memory.

What were you saying?


<!-- 
* Item number one
* Item number two
  * A nested item
* A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

## Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like
[http://ghost.org](http://ghost.org/) - it'll automatically be linked up. But
if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to
[the Ghost website](http://ghost.org/). Neat.

## What about Images?

Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your
article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:

![The Ghost Logo](http://tryghost.org/ghost.png)

Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a
descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the
image in to upload:

## Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said.
It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future
release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.

> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.

## Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline
`<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more
comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

```
awesome-thing {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## Ready for a Break?

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new
divider. Aw yeah.

## Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain
old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!">

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you
think :)
