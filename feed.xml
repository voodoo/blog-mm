No, no, no it is not. Not for some time. But it sure is fun and has been a great learning experience about electricity.

So I needed a guitar. Then I needed to learn it.

Ok, so my Rock Star carreer never really took off and it did not happen exactly like that but designing and learning about guitars has been real fun, even</summary>

No, really, on github that is my handle. Find me there!

What will you find here? Just stuff enjoy - programming, guitars, technology, solar. Mostly this is just for my own memory.

What were you saying?

 Wisdomous - it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a word.

## Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered there, too. You can write inline
`` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more
comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.

```
awesome-thing {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## Ready for a Break?

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new
divider. Aw yeah.

## Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain
old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.



That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you
think :)
